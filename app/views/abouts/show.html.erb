      <p>If I were to start somewhere, I would say that I have always been very attracted to new technologies: my memories go back to the time of my first Word documents (2005? 2006?).<span class="line-break"></span>
      This curiosity has driven me to explore numerous horizons since my early age, both in my personal and professional life.<span class="line-break"></span>
      Added to that, growing up in a military family, living to the rhythm of the many relocations that undoubtedly enriched my journey and my worldview.</p>

      <p>Perhaps that's why I chose an educational path that reflects a thirst for discovery and learning:
      I started with a DUT in Marketing and Sales Techniques in Saint-Nazaire, where I gained solid foundations in marketing and sales,
      Then, I continued with a bachelor's degree in Digital Marketing at SUPDEWEB in Toulouse, alternating as a Community Manager,
      Before completing my studies with a master's degree in Communication at Audencia SciencesCom in Nantes, all while alternating as a Communication Officer.</p>

      <p>After completing my studies and going through this COVID period full of twists and turns and confinement, I felt the need to embark on a different kind of adventure. What was supposed to be a simple one-month trip to Mexico to celebrate the end of my academic journey turned into an incredible year of travel, encounters, work, and discoveries in Australia.</p>
      <p>Upon returning to France, the question of my professional future arose. After being offered a position as a communication officer: the turning point. Although I still enjoy this profession, I felt that something was missing.<span class="line-break"></span>
      That's when an idea that had been brewing for a year resurfaced: I had heard about a Web Developer training program at Le Wagon. Despite my doubts, the fear of the unknown (has it ever stopped me, after all?), I decided to embark on this career change. Having always been attracted to reflection and logic, I believe I have the patience necessary to delve into this field.</p>

      <p>So here I am, ready to explore new perspectives, to combine my passion for communication with my budding skills in web development. Because after all, why not me?</p>

      <p>Best regards,</p>

      <p>Constance</p>
