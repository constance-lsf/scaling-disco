      <h5>MY STORY</h5>
      <p>If I had to start somewhere, I would say that I have always been very attracted to new technologies: my memories go back to the time of my first Word documents (<em>2005? 2006?</em>). This curiosity has driven me to explore numerous horizons since my early age, both in my personal and professional life.</p>
      <h6>Added to that, growing up in a military family, living to the rhythm of the many relocations that undoubtedly enriched my journey and my worldview.</h6>

      <p>After <%= link_to "completing my studies", my_experiences_about_path %> and going through this COVID period full of twists and turns and lockdown, I felt the need to embark on a different kind of adventure. What was supposed to be a simple one-month trip to Mexico to celebrate the end of my academic journey turned into an incredible year of travel, encounters, work, and discoveries in Australia.<br>

      <br>Upon returning to France, the question of my professional future arose. After being offered a position as a communication officer, I reached a turning point where I realized that, although I still enjoyed this profession, I felt that something was missing.
      That's when an idea that had been brewing for a year resurfaced: I had heard about a Web Developer training program at Le Wagon. Despite my doubts, the fear of the unknown (<em>has it ever stopped me, after all?</em>), I decided to embark on this career change.</p>
      <h6>Having always been attracted to reflection and logic, I believe I have the patience needed to delve into this field.</h6>

      <p>So here I am, ready to explore new perspectives, to combine my passion for communication with my budding skills in web development. Because after all, why not me?<br>

      <br><em>Best regards</em>,<br>
