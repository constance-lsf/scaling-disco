        <h5 class="h5-title">MY STORY</h5>
        <p>If I were to start somewhere, I would say that I have always been very attracted to new technologies: my memories go back to the time of my first Word documents <em>(2005? 2006?)</em>.This curiosity has driven me to explore numerous horizons since my early age, both in my personal and professional life.<span class="line-break"></span>
        Added to that, growing up in a military family, living to the rhythm of the many relocations that undoubtedly enriched my journey and my worldview.
        <br>
        <br>Perhaps that's why I chose an educational path that reflects a thirst for <strong>discovery and learning</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>I started with a DUT in <strong>Marketing and Sales Techniques</strong> in Saint-Nazaire, where I gained solid foundations in marketing and sales,</p></li>
          <li><p>Then, I continued with a bachelor's degree in <strong>Digital Marketing</strong> at SUPDEWEB in Toulouse, alternating as a Community Manager,</p></li>
          <li><p>Before completing my studies with a master's degree in <strong>Communication</strong> at Audencia SciencesCom in Nantes, all while alternating as a Communication Officer.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After completing my studies and going through this COVID period full of <em>twists and turns and confinement</em>, I felt the need to embark on a different kind of adventure. What was supposed to be a simple one-month trip to Mexico to celebrate the end of my academic journey turned into <strong>an incredible year of travel, encounters, work, and discoveries in Australia</strong>.<br>
        <br>Upon returning to France, <em>the question of my professional future</em> arose. After being offered a position as a communication officer, I reached a <strong>turning point</strong> where I realized that, although I still enjoyed this profession, I felt that <em>something was missing</em>.<span class="line-break"></span>
        That's when an idea that had been brewing for a year resurfaced: I had heard about a <strong>Web Developer training program at Le Wagon</strong>. Despite my doubts, the fear of the unknown <em>(has it ever stopped me, after all?)</em>, I decided to embark on this career change. Having always been attracted to reflection and logic, I believe I have the patience necessary to delve into this field.<br>
        <br>So here I am, ready to explore new perspectives, to combine my passion for communication with my budding skills in web development. <strong>Because after all, why not me?</strong><br>
        <br><em>Best regards,</em><br>
