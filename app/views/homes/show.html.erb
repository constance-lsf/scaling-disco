<!--
<p>As you probably understood upon arriving on my website, I have just completed a full-stack developer training at Le Wagon, in Paris. This training allowed me to acquire solid technical skills in web development, but also to develop my ability to work in a team, to manage my time and to solve problems. I am now looking for a job as a developer, where I can put my skills to good use and continue to learn and grow.</p>
